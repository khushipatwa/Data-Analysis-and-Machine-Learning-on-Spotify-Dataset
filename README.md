# Spotify Data Analysis and Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of a Spotify dataset with a focus on identifying trends across different years. The project applies data science techniques and machine learning models to extract meaningful insights and predict trends.

## Project Objectives

- **Trend Analysis**: Examine how various attributes of songs (such as tempo, energy, danceability, etc.) have evolved over the years.
- **Feature Engineering**: Develop new features that can be useful in predicting song popularity or other outcomes.
- **Machine Learning**: Build models to predict certain attributes or success metrics of songs based on historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to Spotify tracks, including:

- **Year**: The year the track was released.
- **Acousticness**: A confidence measure of whether the track is acoustic.
- **Danceability**: How suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements.
- **Energy**: A measure of intensity and activity.
- **Instrumentalness**: The likelihood of the track being instrumental.
- **Liveness**: The presence of an audience in the recording.
- **Loudness**: The overall loudness of the track in decibels.
- **Speechiness**: The presence of spoken words in a track.
- **Tempo**: The speed at which a track is played.
- **Valence**: The musical positiveness conveyed by a track.

## Analysis and Modeling

The project is divided into the following key sections:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial data exploration to understand the distribution of features, detect any anomalies, and visualize trends over time.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, normalizing features, and preparing the dataset for modeling.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that may improve the predictive power of the models.
4. **Modeling**: Applying machine learning algorithms to predict specific outcomes (e.g., song popularity, energy, etc.).
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1 score, etc.).

## How to Run

1. **Dependencies**: Install the required Python libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (Note: A `requirements.txt` file should be included listing all dependencies.)

2. **Run the Notebook**: Open the notebook file `DSC_Spotify_Data_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and execute the cells sequentially.

3. **Interpret the Results**: Review the plots and outputs from the notebook to understand the trends and model performance.

## Results and Insights

- Key findings from the analysis and model performance metrics will be documented in the notebook itself.
- Summary of trends observed over the years in the Spotify dataset.

## Future Work

- **Model Tuning**: Further optimization of machine learning models for better accuracy.
- **Additional Features**: Incorporating more features or external datasets to enhance analysis.
- **Deeper Insights**: Conducting a more granular analysis on specific genres or artists.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of trends in music attributes over time using the Spotify dataset and demonstrates the application of data science and machine learning techniques to derive meaningful insights.
